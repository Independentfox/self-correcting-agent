If you can't offer me that, then I'm not interested in hearing any more proposals. Can you do that, Rukmini?",

Additionally, I can waive any pending late fees and provide a revised repayment schedule with a reduced EMI amount. Would this be acceptable to you, or would you like me to explore further options?",

And I don't just want the late fees waived, I want a credit of ₹50,000 to my account for the harassment and distress that QuickLend has caused me.
