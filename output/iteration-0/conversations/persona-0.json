We can discuss options such as a one-time settlement or restructuring your EMIs to make it more manageable for you. What do you think would work best for your current situation?",

I think restructuring my EMIs would be the best option for me - I'm still earning a steady income, I just need a bit more time to adjust to the new expenses. Could we possibly extend the repayment period or reduce the monthly amount for a few months?",

Alternatively, we could extend the repayment period by a few months to reduce the monthly burden. Let me just check what options are available to you... (pause) Okay, I can offer you a reduced EMI of ₹5,000 for the next 6 months, and then we can review and adjust. Would that work for you?",

Yes, I think that would work - the reduced EMI of ₹5,000 for 6 months would give me the breathing room I need to get back on track.

If you're back on track, we can discuss going back to the original EMI amount or we can explore other options, such as a further extension or a revised repayment plan. Let's schedule a follow-up call for 6 months from now to review your progress. In the meantime, I just need you to confirm that you'll start paying the reduced EMI of ₹5,000 from next month, and we'll consider the account updated. Can you confirm that for me?",
