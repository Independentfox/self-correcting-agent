According to our records, your outstanding balance is around ₹250,000 with an overdue amount of ₹50,000.

As for extra charges, there won't be any penalty fees, but the interest will continue to accrue on the outstanding balance. However, we can discuss the possibility of waiving some of the interest accrued during the deferment period, depending on your payment history and overall loan performance.
